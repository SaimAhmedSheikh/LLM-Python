        "explanation": "This screening measures how much of your blood is made of red blood cells. A haematocrit measurement is useful in identifying anaemia, bleeding disorders, liver disease and red cell production within the circulatory system, Haematocrit also shows the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. Blood contains several different types of cells. Haematocrit describes the volume of red cells in the blood it is shown as a percentage of the total blood. High, bone marrow disorder, blood disease, dengue fever, dehydration, lung disease (COPD), AAS use, shock. Low, low blood oxygen, anaemia, haemorrhage, heavy bleeding with menstruation, Hodgkin\u2122s lymphoma, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, leukaemia, toxins."

        "explanation": "The red cell distribution width (RDW) blood test is a calculation of the variation in the size and shape of red blood cells. In this case, fiwidthfl refers to the measurement of distribution, not the size of the cells. You need red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to every part of your body. Anything outside of the normal range in red blood cell width or volume indicates a possible problem with bodily function that in turn may affect oxygen getting to various parts of your body. However, with certain diseases, you may still have a normal RDW. Normal red blood cells maintain a standard size of 6 to 8 micrometres in diameter. If cells are larger, your RDW blood test values will have higher numbers. High, iron deficiency anaemia, bone marrow disorder, reticulocytosis, liver disease, AAS use. Low, Normal not important."

        "explanation": "MCH is a calculation of the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin (RBC) It is calculated by dividing the mass of HgB by volume of red blood cells. Haemoglobin is the oxygen carrying molecule in blood. Higher levels of haemoglobin the greater oxygen capability thus increased cardio endurance. Mean cell haemoglobin is the average mass of haemoglobin per each red blood cell. This means the concentration of haemoglobin the red blood cell is too high and is normally accompanied by an increase in mean cell volume (which in this case is just below the upper limit) this is usually caused by a low number of red blood cells which is compensated for by making the cells larger. if you look at the RBC count you will see that it is low. High, associated with an increased level of haemoglobin leading to anaemia (macrocytic), caused by insufficient levels of folic acid and vitamin B12. Low, caused by iron-deficiency anaemia or hyperchromic anaemia, vitamin deficiency in conjunction with low mean corpuscular volume (small RBCs)."

They are produced in the bone marrow and act as the body\u2122s protectors against infectious disease and foreign invaders that lead to illness and/or injury. Slightly low WBCs may be a natural level for some people. When a person gets an infection, WBCs will increase in numbers in order to attack the invaders. To bring WBCs levels back to normal, the spleen and the rest of the lymphatic system (which produces white blood cells, or corpuscles) needs to be brought back to balance. High, (leucocytosis) bacterial infections, blood disorders, leukaemia, allergies, asthma, tissue damage, anxiety, strenuous exercise, severe stress, inflammation.

CPK isoenzymes are broken down into three (3) categories: 1. CK:MM - derived from skeletal muscle. 2. CK: MB - derived from heart muscle. 3. CK:BB - derived from brain and nerve tissue and may also be a useful marker for prostate, breast, ovarian, colon, lung, and digestive tract cancers. High, when total CK level is remarkably high, it usually means there has been injury or stress to muscle tissue, heart, or brain.

It is composed of Haem, which effects the colour of the RBCs. Higher the levels of haemoglobin the greater oxygen capability thus increased cardio endurance. This level will increase if a person is dehydrated but also drugs such as EPO, equipoise and Oxymetholone all increase levels. Low levels are referred to as anaemia. High levels can add to high blood pressure; low levels can result in increased fatigue. Restrictive oxygen training will also increase levels. The amount of Haemoglobin determines how much oxygen the RBCs can carry to other cells. High, the blood is too thick, over production of red blood cells, COPD, congestive heart failure, or AAS use.

Testosterone also causes a boy's voice to deepen. Men continue to make testosterone. It boosts sex drive and helps make sperm. Women's ovaries also make small amounts of testosterone. It helps many organs and body processes in women. The pituitary gland in your brain controls the amount of testosterone your body makes. Most of the testosterone in your blood attaches to 2 proteins: albumin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Some testosterone is not attached to proteins, or free.

        "result": "Result H 66.16",
        "range": "Range mg/l <5.0",
        "explanation": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein that increases in the blood, which is made by the liver in response to inflammation and infection as well as following a heart attack, surgery, or trauma. Studies have suggested that a persistent low level of inflammation plays a major role in atherosclerosis, the narrowing of blood vessels due to build-up of cholesterol and other lipids, which is often associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The HS-CRP test accurately measures low levels of CRP to identify low but persistent levels of inflammation and thus helps predict a person's risk of developing CVD. Any levels above 3 are regarded as high risk however training within 24 hrs of bloods being drawn will elevate readings. So, to get a more accurate reading abstain from training for 48 hours and retest. High, Infection (viral or bacterial), auto-immune disease (practically all of them), cancer, long term illness, heart disease, Lyme disease. Low, Favourable of little concern."

        "explanation": "CK is elevated in cardiac conditions, muscular dystrophy, muscle damage/degeneration, brain damage/inflammation, and strenuous exercise, also other conditions include hypoparathyroidism, oedema, and influenza. CPK isoenzymes are broken down into three (3) categories: 1. CK:MM - derived from skeletal muscle. 2. CK: MB - derived from heart muscle. 3. CK:BB - derived from brain and nerve tissue and may also be a useful marker for prostate, breast, ovarian, colon, lung, and digestive tract cancers. High, when total CK level is remarkably high, it usually means there has been injury or stress to muscle tissue, heart, or brain. This can include heart attack, heart muscle inflammation, heart injury, muscular dystrophy, brain injury, convulsions, electric shock.

        "explanation": "Iron (Fe+) is the active component of haemoglobin (which carries oxygen in the blood). Iron is critical for red blood cells and is also needed for cellular energy and healthy muscle and organ function. Iron is a mineral in your body that comes from foods like red meat and fortified cereals or from supplements you take. High iron can cause joint pain, fatigue, heart problems and weakness. False high, birth control pills, excessive vitamin c intake. Low, anaemia, reduced ferritin levels, slow development in children, fatigue and poor cognition."

        "explanation": "Creatinine is a waste product by the body when creatine, a metabolism substance that helps convert food into energy, breaks down. Usually, your kidneys help filter creatinine out of the blood and the waste product is then passed out of the body via urine. High creatinine indicates a problem with your kidneys and is the most used indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is found in skeletal muscle and heart muscle. It is worth noting the weight training will also spike creatinine levels above normal and often above range limit. High, muscular dystrophy decrease in kidney function (nephritis), long term diabetes, extensive hypertension, shock, enlarged prostate, supplementation of creatine. False high, antibiotic overuse, sedatives, barbiturates, high dose vitamin C. Low, an extremely low protein diet, liver disease, decreased muscle mass (cachexia) False low, pregnancy, some BP drugs."

        "explanation": "Sodium is one of the bodies primary minerals and opposes (effectively its opposite) potassium. It is essential to the acid/base (pH) balance and intra-cellular fluid exchange for the bodies water distribution it helps maintain blood pressure and blood volume and is essential in our nerves and muscles working correctly. Sodium pumps water and nutrients into the cell wall and is primarily under the control of the adrenal cortex. Chloride pumps water and nutrients through the cell wall and the potassium essentially moves them about inside of the cell. Sodium works in a very narrow range and is excreted by the kidneys. Damaged kidneys will let too much pass through or not enough. High, may increase blood pressure, chance of heart failure, kidney damage, diabetes, dehydration, coma, Cushing syndrome. False high, high salt diet, low fluid intake, steroids, diuretics, sweating, pain relieving medications. Low uncommon but can occur in alkalinity deficiency (acidosis)and adrenal over activity, oedema, burns. False low, too little salt intake, vomiting diarrhoea, diuretics."

Much of the testosterone in the blood is bound to a protein called sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Total testosterone is the total amount of testosterone in the body this includes testosterone that is free floating and testosterone that is bound by various receptors and proteins in the blood and tissue. Low levels in either can cause symptoms. High, resistance to the action on male hormones (androgen resistance), cancer of testes, congenital hyperplasia. AAS use.

        "explanation": "This test measures the amount of unattached, or \"free,\" testosterone in your blood. Testosterone is a male sex hormone (androgen) that helps male features develop. Testosterone is made in the testes and the adrenal glands. It causes the changes that occur in boys during puberty. Testosterone helps hair and muscles grow. It also helps the penis and testes grow. Testosterone also causes a boy's voice to deepen. Men continue to make testosterone. It boosts sex drive and helps make sperm. Women's ovaries also make small amounts of testosterone. It helps many organs and body processes in women. The pituitary gland in your brain controls the amount of testosterone your body makes. Most of the testosterone in your blood attaches to 2 proteins: albumin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Some testosterone is not attached to proteins, or free. Free testosterone and albumin-bound testosterone are also referred to as bioavailable testosterone. This is the testosterone that is easily used by your body."

Small amounts are produced in the adrenal glands and some peripheral tissue, mostly fat. Estrogen is the primary female hormone thought it plays many important roles in males too. From libido to cholesterol management and even has an influence on eyesight. High, hypogonadism (check LH and FSH levels) polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), androgen producing tumours, cancer, early puberty, cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, oestrogen dominance, disease of hypothalamus, AAS use. False high, could be functional causes such as starvation, over exercise, severe emotional/physical stress, excess drug use alcohol abuse.

        "explanation": "The FSH blood test measures the level of FSH in blood. FSH is a hormone released by the pituitary gland, located on the underside of the brain. In women FSH helps control the menstrual cycle and the production of eggs by the ovaries. The amount of FSH varies throughout the woman\u2122s menstrual cycle and is highest just before she releases an egg (ovulates) In men, FSH helps control the production of sperm. The amount in men normally remains constant. Follicle stimulating hormone is released by the pituitary and stimulates sperm production via the Sertoli cells in the testes. High, (women)during or after menopause, including premature menopause, when receiving hormone therapy, tumour in the pituitary gland, turner\u2122s syndrome. High (men), advancing age, (male menopause), damage to testicles (chemotherapy or radiation) treatment with hormones, tumours in pituitary gland.

        "explanation": "DHEA stands for dehydroepiandrosterone. It is a weak but most abundant hormone (androgen) produced by the adrenal glands in both men and women. The DHEA-sulphate test measures the amount of DHEA-sulphate in the blood. It is done as a check of adrenal gland function. Low levels can cause depression and anxiety. Levels can be brought up by supplementing DHEA. If your level of DHEA-S is high, it means that your body is making too much of the hormones. This excess may be related to adrenal cancer, tumours, or excess growth of adrenal hormone-producing tissue (hyperplasia). If your DHEA level is low, it may mean that your adrenal glands are not making enough hormones. High Is associated with Cushing disease, adrenal cancer, adrenocortical tumour, adrenal hyperplasia. Low, adrenal insufficiency, adrenal dysfunction, atherosclerotic plaque, nerve degeneration, Addison\u2122s disease, hypopituitarism, vulnerability to breast, prostate, and bladder cancer."
